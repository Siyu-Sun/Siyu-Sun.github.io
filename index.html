      In Siyu Sun's personal website, I wrote brief introductions of myself, the courses I have attended,

    <p class="another-special-color">
      In Siyu Sun's planner, there will be a login page, and after log in the account, there will be a planner
      for one to write their goals for each day, each week, and each month, and allow one to select how much they have finished
      their goals and the planner will calculate the completion rate for each day, week, and month.
      Aim of the planner is to let people better manage their time and improve efficiency and can also act as a normal planner
      to write down what they want to do and what they have done.<br /><br /><br /><br />

        Symmedian Point research project:
      </h3>
      <h3>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a research project with Professor Lu investigating Symmedian Point, which are intersections of three symmedians. In the project,
        I wrote proof of why three symmedians are concurrent at one point, the Symmedian Point, as well as properties of Symmedian Point.
        To show what will the Symmedian Point be like I wrote an animation of Symmedian Point in a triangle using Javascript.
        I also give a presentation about my research topic, Symmedian Point, in Professor Lu's Math 199A class.
